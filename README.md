Pseudo-3D / '2.5D' / Doom / BUILD style engine
----------------------------------------------

Real 3d engine is too easy (Threejs etc). Inside this oldschool type of engine there isn't really such a concept as the polygon/triangle.
Instead the world is made of extruded lines, tricks, hacks, and texture mapping with horizontal/vert strips.
Code is pure html5 js, no additional libraries/extensions/apis etc.
